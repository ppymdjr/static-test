* Test ORG file

This is an amazing test 'org-mode' file.

I seem to be able to edit this directly from the web interface, which is cool (and what I wanted).

Do tables work?

| one                                      | two  | thre |
|------------------------------------------+------+------|
| another cell with more information in it | blah |      |

- bulleted lists?
- with several items?

I should try images

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defun factorial (x)
   (if (< x 3)
       x
       (* x (fact (- x 1)))))
#+END_SRC

* iOS Editing

I can even edit thus from iOS, which is nice.
